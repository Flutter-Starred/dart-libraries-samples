# dart:html


HTML elements and other resources for web-based applications that need to
interact with the browser and the DOM (Document Object Model).
 *
This library includes DOM element types, CSS styling, local storage,
media, speech, events, and more.
To get started,
check out the [Element] class, the base class for many of the HTML
DOM types.
 *
## Other resources

* If you've never written a web app before, try our
tutorials&mdash;[A Game of Darts](http://dartlang.org/docs/tutorials).
 *
* To see some web-based Dart apps in action and to play with the code,
download
[Dart Editor](http://www.dartlang.org/#get-started)
and run its built-in examples.
